# windows-script-encoding
A free and open source windows script host encoder for VBScript and JScript files.<br />
**I struggled to find nearly any documentation on the windows script encoder, so I created this VBScript which does it for you.**

# About
Encoding your windows script host scripts is an important part of deveoping windows script-based malware, otherwise the target can read exactly what it is you wrote, leaving you with the job of obfuscation.<br />
This script encoder will encode your VBScript and JScript files so that they are unreadable.

# Download
To download this encoder, click [here](https://github.com/Yochran/windows-script-encoding/releases/download/2.0.0/install.vbs) and run through the install script..
<br /><br />
**You (might?) have to turn off your AntiVirus product for the executable to work (because Windows Defender doesn't like uncommon executables)**
